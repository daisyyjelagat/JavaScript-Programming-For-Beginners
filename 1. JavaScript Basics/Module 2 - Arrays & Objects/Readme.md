##### Object Literals VS Function Constructors
| ASPECT | OBJECT LITERALS | FUNCTION CONSTRUCTORS | 
| ---|---|---|
| Purpose | Suitable for ad hoc object | Ideal for creating multiple instances with shared properties and methods | 
| Use Case | Storing individual customer orders | Creating instances of objects like "Car" | 
| Scenario | Unique details for specific instances | Managing and modeling multiple similar objects (users, products, vehicles) |
| Advantage | Quick Creation of one-off objects | Provides a structured and organized approach | 
| Applicability | Adaptable for various scenarios | Especially useful for OOP in JavaScript |
